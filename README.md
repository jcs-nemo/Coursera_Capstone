# Covid-19_Report_Capstone
COVID-19 outbreak has infected more than 1 million people as of April 30th, 2020. Government agencies and healthcare institutions in Orange County, California, wants to evaluate if the current medical resources are sufficient to support the growing number of patients. 

The goal of this capstone project is to apply K-means clustering method to conduct hospitals capacity, patients number, and infection density segregation and draw conclusion from the dataset. The data visualizations are made using Foursquare API and Folium libraries to show the healthcare capacity distribution in Orange County. 

Through data processing, clustering, and visualization, we learned that two cities are currently overwhelmed by COVID-19 patient and they need immediate attention from the government. Financial support as well as medical support should be implemented right away to assist local medical institutions in those regions.
